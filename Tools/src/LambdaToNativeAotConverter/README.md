# Lambda to NativeAOT Converter

This tool will convert an existing .NET 6 Lambda project to be a .NET 6 NativeAOT Lambda. It needs to be given the path to your project file, the handler name, and the path to the file where the handler is defined. It does these things:

1. Sets OutputType to exe
1. Sets AssemblyName to bootstrap
1. Adds a package reference to the ILCompiler which will compile the code to linux-native assembly
1. Adds a package reference to the Amazon.Lambda.RuntimeSupport so that we can bootstrap our own executable
1. Adds a main method for the executable to start in
1. Updates or adds a Lambda tool defaults configuration which knows how to deploy as a native executable

This is a console app, to use, just run the project and give the needed input when prompted. **It will upgrade the given project in place, so it is recommended to use source control and/or backup your existing code before running the conversion.**
